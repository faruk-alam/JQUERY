Standard jQuery Syntax
A jQuery statement typically starts with the dollar sign ($) and ends with a semicolon (;).

In jQuery, the dollar sign ($) is just an alias for jQuery. Let's consider the following example code which 
demonstrates the most basic statement of the jQuery.


<script>
    $(document).ready(function(){
        // Some code to be executed...
        alert("Hello World!");
    });
</script>

The above example simply displays an alert message "Hello World!" to the user.

Explanation of code :
The $(document).ready(handler); â€” This statement is typically known as ready event. Where the handler is 
basically a function that is passed to the ready() method to be executed safely as soon as the document is ready 
to be manipulated i.e. when the DOM hierarchy has been fully constructed.
The jQuery ready() method is typically used with an anonymous function. So, the above example can also be written in 
a shorthand notation like this:

<script>
    $(function(){
        // Some code to be executed...
        alert("Hello World!");
    });
</script>
Tip: You can use any syntax you like as both the syntax are equivalent. However, the document ready event is 
easier to understand when reading the code.
Further, inside an event handler function you can write the jQuery statements to perform any action following 
the basic syntax, like: $(selector).action();
Where, the $(selector) basically selects the HTML elements from the DOM tree so that it can be manipulated 
and the action() applies some action on the selected elements such as changes the CSS property value, or sets 
the element's contents, etc.
