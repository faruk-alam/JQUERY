jQuery Effects:
jQuery enables us to add effects on a web page. jQuery effects can be categorized into fading, sliding, hiding/
showing and animation effects.

jQuery provides many methods for effects on a web page. A complete list of jQuery effect methods are given 
below:

jQuery hide()
The jQuery hide() method is used to hide the selected elements.
Syntax:

$(selector).hide();  
$(selector).hide(speed, callback);  
$(selector).hide(speed, easing, callback);  
speed: It is an optional parameter. It specifies the speed of the delay. Its possible vales are slow, fast 
and milliseconds.
easing: It specifies the easing function to be used for transition.

jQuery show()
The jQuery show() method is used to show the selected elements.

Syntax:

$(selector).show();  
$(selector).show(speed, callback);  
$(selector).show(speed, easing, callback);  
speed: It is an optional parameter. It specifies the speed of the delay. Its possible vales are slow, fast 
and milliseconds.
easing: It specifies the easing function to be used for transition.
callback: It is also an optional parameter. It specifies the function to be called after completion of 
show() effect.

jQuery toggle()
The jQuery toggle() is a special type of method which is used to toggle between the hide() and show() method. 
It shows the hidden elements and hides the shown element.

Syntax:
$(selector).toggle();  
$(selector).toggle(speed, callback);  
$(selector).toggle(speed, easing, callback);  
$(selector).toggle(display);  
speed: It is an optional parameter. It specifies the speed of the delay. Its possible vales are slow, fast 
and milliseconds.
easing: It specifies the easing function to be used for transition.
callback: It is also an optional parameter. It specifies the function to be called after completion of 
toggle() effect.
display: If true, it displays element. If false, it hides the element.

jQuery fadeIn()
jQuery fadeIn() method is used to fade in the element.

Syntax:
$(selector).fadein();  
$(selector).fadeIn(speed,callback);   
$(selector).fadeIn(speed, easing, callback);  
speed: It is an optional parameter. It specifies the speed of the delay. Its possible vales are slow, fast 
and milliseconds.

easing: It specifies the easing function to be used for transition.
callback: It is also an optional parameter. It specifies the function to be called after completion of 
fadein() effect.

jQuery fadeOut()
The jQuery fadeOut() method is used to fade out the element.
Syntax:

$(selector).fadeOut();  
$(selector).fadeOut(speed,callback);   
$(selector).fadeOut(speed, easing, callback);  
speed: It is an optional parameter. It specifies the speed of the delay. Its possible vales are slow, fast 
and milliseconds.
easing: It specifies the easing function to be used for transition.
callback: It is also an optional parameter. It specifies the function to be called after completion of 
fadeOut() effect.

jQuery slideUp()
jQuery slideUp() method is used to slide up an element.
Syntax:

$(selector).slideUp(speed);  
$(selector).slideUp(speed, callback);   
$(selector).slideUp(speed, easing, callback);  
speed: It specifies the speed of the delay. Its possible vales are slow, fast and milliseconds.
easing: It specifies the easing function to be used for transition.
callback: It is also an optional parameter. It specifies the function to be called after completion of 
slideUp() effect.

jQuery stop() Method
The jQuery stop() method is used to stop the jQuery animations or effects currently running on the selected 
elements before it completes.

The basic syntax of the jQuery stop() method can be given with:

$(selector).stop(stopAll, goToEnd);
The parameters in the above syntax have the following meanings:

The optional stopAll Boolean parameter specifies whether to remove queued animation or not. Default value is 
false, that means only the current animation will be stopped, rest of the animations in the queue will run 
afterwards.
The optional goToEnd Boolean parameter specifies whether to complete the current animation immediately. 
Default value is false.
