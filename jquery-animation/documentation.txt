jQuery animate() Method

The jQuery animate() method is used to create custom animations. The animate() method is typically used to 
animate numeric CSS properties, for example, width, height, margin, padding, opacity, top, left, etc. but 
the non-numeric properties such as color or background-color cannot be animated using the basic jQuery 
functionality.

Note: Not all CSS properties are animatable. In general, any CSS property that accepts values that are 
numbers, lengths, percentages, or colors is animatable. However, the color animation is not support by the 
core jQuery library. To manipulate and animate the color use the jQuery color plugin.
